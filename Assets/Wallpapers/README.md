# Kubuntu Wallpapers

Three folders ./JPG, ./PNG, ./SVG are the brand designers implementations, and the primary wallpapers that ship with Kubuntu.

In addition ./Contest_24.04 holds the wallpaper submissions from the three Wallpaper Contest winners.

## Important SVG Wallaper information

Some the wallpaper, those with the 3D gear icon were created using Figma, and have some extension effects applied, which makes them incompatible with tools like Inkscape.
In this case those wallpapers are shared to a Figma community
